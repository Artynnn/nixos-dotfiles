These are my dotfiles, meant to be used for nixOS.

The great benefit of NixOS, is that I can define my whole computer in one textfile and get all those features once invoked. No more writing 50 commands to restore my system or transfer it to a new computer. Everything about my computer is clear.

My configuration.nix supports the following:

- Wayland / Sway
- Pipewire
- Firefox nightly
- Emacs built from latest git commit

To build (please be extremly careful!):

#+begin_src sh
# where this is located
cd ~/projects/nixos-dotfiles
sudo nixos-rebuild switch -I nixos-config=./configuration.nix
#+end_src
